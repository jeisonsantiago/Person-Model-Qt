# Person-Model-Qt
Simple implementation of a `QAbstractListModel` using Qt.

# Motivation
To be used as reference in my side-projects.

# Usage
Just clone and open the project file with **QtCreator**, have fun, as usual :D

# Note
Feel free to use it. You can just replace the `Person` class 
with something else, I whould recommend change the way `QMimeData` sends the information in the
drag/drop section because I just used JSON modules from `Qt`.

Any questions email me: jeison.santiago at gmail.com
